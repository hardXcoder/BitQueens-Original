<h3>2.THE BITQUEEN WEBSITE</h3>
<br></br>
BitQueen is a collection of 10,000 unique digital artworks (stored in .png format on IPFS), each represented by a NFT. The BitQueen NFTs are sold during an initial sales period of up to 20 days according to the price schedule displayed on the website (www.bitqueens.com). All unsold NFTs during the initial sales period will remain purchasable after the initial sales period has concluded as the sale is encoded in the smart contract but will not entitled to claim the promotional CQNT tokens. The Founders do not provide any additional services to the user after the business transaction is concluded. You can access the Site via any web browser using the URL https://www.bitqueens.com and an electronic BSC wallet compatible with the NFT standard on the BSC network. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the Site other than through BSC-compatible browsers. Transactions on the Site are managed and confirmed via the BSC blockchain. We have absolutely no effect or control on MetaMask, Google Chrome, the BSC network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the Site and make the transaction. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>


<h3>3. PURCHASE OF THE BITQUEEN</h3>
<br></br>
If you decide to purchase a BitQueen digital art NFT, any financial transactions will be conducted solely through the BSC network. The Purchaser shall acknowledge that the Founders have no liability to the Purchaser or to any third party for any material or immaterial claims, damages or costs that may arise as a result of any transactions that is engaged by means of the Site, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the BSC network. Once the payment or the transaction is made, we have no control to reverse any transaction and we have no control over the payment system and mechanism whatsoever.

<br></br>
<br></br>

The Purchaser shall acknowledge that is solely responsible for his/her MetaMask wallet, and other BSC wallets, if applicable and the private key to access it.

<br></br>
<br></br>

BSC requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the BSC network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized BSC network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Site. The Gas Fee does not constitute part of the NFT price, we are not benefitted from that at all and we have no control over its pricing. All paid prices exclude any possible duties or charges. You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, duties and customs if applicable in relation to the purchase and ownership of the NFT from the BitQueen collection, now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”), under any jurisdiction in the world, under any tax laws and treaties. The Purchaser shall declare and warrant that is not resident (including tax resident) in any of the countries which have any – even partial – legal restriction regarding the purchase, acquisition, ownership of any crypto currencies, crypto tokens, cyber currencies or any other similar currencies and tokens and Purchasers shall declare under this Agreement that they do not do or attempt to do any action directly or indirectly what should mean the breach money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws under any jurisdiction the Purchaser is related to.

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>


<h3>4. ACQUISITION OF EXPLOITATION RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP</h3>

<br></br>
The Founders acknowledge that by the purchase of the NFT in exchange of the price as determined on the Site, the Purchaser acquires the unlimited exploitation rights and ownership of the NFT. Each BitQueen is an NFT on the BSC blockchain. When you purchase a NFT, you own the underlying BitQueen, the Artwork, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the BSC Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any BitQueen. We strictly prohibit the use of offensive language in the name giving process. Any insulting names will be removed from the User Interface. Since the smart contracts are open to anyone, we cannot hinder or influence a name change on the BSC blockchain. The Purchaser shall acknowledge and agree that the Artworks will run under the name “BitQueen” and the artists will not be named individually as the Artworks are digitally generated compilation of digital graphic artworks and each Artwork therefore may have numerous authors. This also means that the Purchaser is not obliged to credit any of the authors while exploiting the Artworks and the NFTs. The Founders would like to ask the Purchasers to make the name “BitQueen” appear during the exploitation of the NFTs, but it is not mandatory. However, no Purchaser shall be entitled to use and exploit the NFT and the Artwork under his/her/its own name, either real name or alias and shall not make the public assume that the Purchaser is the author of the used NFT and Artwork, not even in the event of a derivative work or any adaptation, neither in case of partial use. The Purchaser shall also acknowledge and agree that the Founders remain entitled to make the purchased Artworks appear on the Site and related websites and applications, promotions, marketing materials and communications, social media sites. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, the Founders grant to the Purchaser the unlimited, worldwide, exclusive license to use the purchased Artwork for any private or commercial use. The granted exploitation rights include but are not limited the following: (a) copy and any digital or other multiplication, (b) distribution, (c) public performance, (d) exhibition, display, (f) any kind and for of communication to the public, online, on demand, and kind of streaming, any type of transmission, (e) derivation, adaptation, (f) commercial sales, including exploitation in promotions and commercials, (g) use in any audiovisual work, (h) publishing in digital or print, (i) using in compilations of works, (j) secondary merchandising (mugs, T-shirts, other items and products).
<br></br>
<br></br>
The Founders stipulate that the Purchaser shall respect the original purposes of the purchased Artwork and is prohibited to use the Artworks or to permit the use of the Artworks for harmful or defamatory purposes regarding third parties (individuals or entities), for pornographic, violent, racist purposes, and shall not be used or licensed to be used in connection with hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.
<br></br>
<br></br>
For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section 3 will be deemed to restrict you from owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of BitQueen generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each BitQueen Artwork owner’s rights to display the Artwork and to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Artwork, and provided that the Artwork is no longer visible once the owner of the purchased BitQueen leaves the website/application. You as the owner of the Artwork are entitled to earn revenue from any of the foregoing and the Founders confirm that the purchase price of the NFT includes the whole license fee in exchange of the granted and acquired exploitation rights. The Purchaser is entitled to assign/transfer the ownership of the purchased NFT on the BSC blockchain.
<br></br>
<br></br>
It shall be acknowledged and understood that by the purchase of the NFT Artworks only and exclusively the NFT will be purchased and in no event it shall be interpreted or understood that the purchase includes or in extended to any third party IP (intellectual property).
<br></br>
