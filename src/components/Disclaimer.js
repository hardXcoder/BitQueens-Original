RISKS. OUR SERVICES RELY ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS BSC. SOME SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISK THROUGH YOUR POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THINGS SUCH AS PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY. BY USING THE SERVICES YOU EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THESE HEIGHTENED RISKS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING:
<br></br>
<br></br>

There are risks associated with using cryptocurrencies, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that the Founders will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the BSC network, wallets and other related means, however caused.
<br></br>
<br></br>

The prices of blockchain assets are very volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your BitQueen, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of BitQueen will not lose money. Risk of loss of private key or passphrase(s): The Founders are not responsible for your private keys, which you need in order to access the NFTs. It is your sole responsibility to protect your private keys. In case of lost, the company takes no responsibility.
<br></br>
<br></br>

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens are uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the BitQueen ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of BitQueen.

<br></br>
<br></br>
Upgrades by BSC to the BSC platform, a hard fork in the BSC platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the BSC platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains, including the BitQueen ecosystem.
